# Network-Penetration-Testing
This project demonstrates practical network penetration testing by combining three powerful tools â€” Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark. It includes active and passive information gathering, port scanning, vulnerability detection, and packet analysis to uncover potential security risks in a target network.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Nmap: Network mapper for host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration

Nessus: Industry-standard vulnerability scanner for identifying security flaws

Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer for monitoring, capturing, and analyzing packets in real-time
